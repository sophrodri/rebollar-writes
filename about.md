## Since her pre-med days, Sophie Rebollar escaped the day to day studying with reading and writing poems and creative novelas that validate the inner thoughts and feelings of women trapped in a man's world; dealing with situations of body image, self-discovery, and social anxiety that are rarely talked about.
